  <strong>Another Better Mihomo Client</strong>
</p>

Bettbox is a multi-platform proxy client based on an early version of FlClash, refactored and powered by the Mihomo (Clash Meta) core.

Following the principle of "Better Experience", Bettbox inherits the excellent user interface of the original project while deeply optimizing numerous details and internal logic. It aims to be a Mihomo client that delivers a smooth frontend experience, silent and power-efficient background operation, and long-term stability.

**Supported Core Protocols**: Shadowsocks ( R / 2022 ), Trojan, VMess, VLESS ( XHTTP / Reality ), Hysteria ( v1 / v2 ), TUIC, WireGuard, Tailscale, OpenVPN, SSH, AnyTLS, Mieru, Snell ( v1-v5 ), Masque, Sudoku, Gost-relay, as well as standard HTTP/Socks5, etc.

Bettbox stands for: Better Experience, Out of the box.

## ❓ FAQ

1. **Cannot launch after installation?**
   - For older Android devices, verify that your system meets the minimum requirement (Android 8.0+).
   - For older desktop devices, ensure you have downloaded the appropriate "Compatible" version for your CPU architecture.
   - If the issue persists, please open an Issue.

2. **Common Desktop Issues**
   - **Windows Administrator Privileges**: Handled automatically during installation; no manual authorization is required afterward.
   - **Unable to start TUN adapter**: On macOS and Linux, ensure you enter the correct administrator password when prompted.
   - **Other errors**: Please provide runtime logs and verify that no conflicting proxy software is running simultaneously.

3. **Unable to import subscription links**
